# SherlockHolmesAI


### üì¶ Project Overview
SherlockAI Lite is a lightweight, CSP-compliant Chrome extension that uses in-browser face-landmark detection to flag when a test‚Äêtaker looks away from their main screen during remote interviews or online exams. It injects TensorFlow.js UMD bundles locally‚Äîno remote scripts or `eval()`‚Äîand logs ‚Äúüü¢ Centered‚Äù or ‚Äúüî¥ Looking away‚Äù in the page console.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Manifest V3** Chrome Extension  
- **HTML/CSS/JS** for popup & background  
- **TensorFlow.js** UMD bundles (tfjs-core, tfjs-converter, face-landmarks-detection)  
- **WebRTC getUserMedia()** for webcam capture  
- **AnimationFrame** loop for real-time detection  

---

### üöÄ Installation (for local dev)
1. Clone or unzip into a folder, e.g. `sherlockai-lite/`.  
2. Download and place these files in that folder:
   - `tfjs-core.min.js`  
   - `tfjs-converter.min.js`  
   - `face-landmarks-detection.min.js`  
   - `content.js`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, `background.js`, `manifest.json`  
3. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, and select your folder.  
4. Open any webcam-enabled page (Meet, Zoom Web, Teams, or your own test HTML).  
5. Click the SherlockAI icon ‚Üí **Start Tracking**, then open that tab‚Äôs DevTools ‚Üí Console to see logs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Challenges We Faced
1. **CSP Errors**  
   - Remote `<script>` tags (MediaPipe CDN) were blocked.  
   - `eval()` usage in clmtrackr caused Manifest V3 CSP violations.

2. **Import Syntax**  
   - ES6 `import ‚Ä¶` isn‚Äôt allowed in plain content scripts under Manifest V3.

3. **Browser API Limitations**  
   - Native FaceDetector API isn‚Äôt generally available or is blocked by page CSPs.

4. **Bundling Models**  
   - Need to include TensorFlow.js UMD bundles locally to satisfy CSP.

5. **Cross-site Support**  
   - Avoid Meet-only hacks; solution must run on arbitrary pages.

---

### ‚úÖ What We Tried
- Dynamic `<script>` injection  
- clmtrackr (failed due to `unsafe-eval`)  
- MediaPipe via CDN (blocked by CSP)  
- Native FaceDetector API (not universally supported)  
- **Final solution**: Local TensorFlow.js UMD bundles + pure‚ÄêJS content script

---

### üî≠ Next Steps
- Tune gaze thresholds (frames, boundary ratios)  
- Capture and aggregate logs for session reports  
- Badge extension icon or popup UI for real-time alerts  
- Add mouse/tab-switch detection for multi-monitor inference  
- Hook into a small backend (optional) for persistence
